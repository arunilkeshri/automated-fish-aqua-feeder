# AquaFeeder: Automated Fish Feeding System 🐠✨

## 🌟 Project Overview

This project was born out of a very personal incident.  
While I was away on a short vacation, I lost some of my pet fish because they weren’t fed on time.  
That really hit me. So, I decided to create a **robust, offline-capable fish feeding system** using the ESP8266 microcontroller.

> Now, even if there's **no internet**, my fish will get fed on time. Every time.

## 🛠️ Features

- ⏱️ Scheduled Feeding Twice Daily  
- 🔁 Double Servo Rotation to Ensure Proper Feed Drop  
- 🌐 Telegram Alerts for Feeding Confirmation  
- 🔌 Power-Efficient (LED only active during feeding)  
- 📴 Works **even without Internet** after being programmed  
- 🧠 Smart yet **student-built & DIY-friendly**

## 💡 Inspiration

This isn’t just a project; it's a solution to a real problem.

> I wanted peace of mind—knowing that no matter where I am, my fish are taken care of.  
> This feeder is my small tribute to that idea.
